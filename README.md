## List of Ontologies    
      
### Very simple ones, to better understand the concepts

### Getting more 'real-world' now        
      
These are a bit more complex, but we are still treating these datasets as relational, object-oriented representations of the domain.       
In later examples/exercises, we will leverage the "connected" nature of Ontologies for data analysis.
