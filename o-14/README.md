## **Scenario-based competency questions** for Ontology #14: Distribution & Logistics Domain                                 
                                 
1. **Vehicle Breakdown**: “What if a key **Vehicle** in a given **TransportHub** fails mid-route—does that force re-routing **Shipments** to another hub, or do we create a ‘DeliverySchedule’ delay?”                                 
2. **Over-Capacity Warehouse**: “If a certain **Warehouse** surpasses its ‘capacity’ by adding new **InventoryItem** sets, do we automatically create a backlog or partial refusal for new shipments from the same ‘DistributionNetwork’?”                                 
3. **Driver Shortage**: “What if half the **Driver** objects are unavailable—can the remaining drivers handle the existing routes, or do we see partial route coverage for certain ‘Route’ objects?”                                 
4. **Contract Renegotiation**: “If a certain **SupplyContract** changes terms, do existing **Shipments** referencing that contract remain valid or become flagged for new cost calculations in the pipeline transforms?”                                 
5. **Multi-Route Shipment**: “Which **Shipment** must traverse multiple **Route** segments with the same **Vehicle**? Could that exceed the load capacity if we unify them in one long route?”                                 
6. **FleetManagementSystem Upgrade**: “If we replace an older system with a new version, how many **Vehicle** references or ‘integratedWith’ relationships do we break, and how do we restore them for each ‘TransportHub’ object type in Foundry?”                                 
7. **Delayed Schedules**: “What if storms cause an entire day’s worth of **DeliverySchedule** to shift +24 hours—do we recalculate the arrivalTime for each route or create partial fallback routes for essential shipments?”                                 
8. **PackingUnit Merge**: “Could we unify multiple small **PackingUnit** sets into a single larger one if we re-check ‘maxItems’? Do we reduce the total shipments or create a new ‘DeliverySchedule’ for consolidated cargo?”                                 
9. **Sudden Demand Surge**: “If an unexpected demand spike doubles **InventoryItem** quantity at a certain warehouse, do we run out of space or re-allocate some ‘InventoryItem’ to a second warehouse in the same ‘DistributionNetwork’?”

Below is a conceptual structure, with a **pseudocode** approach.                               
                              
                                      
                                      
                                                                                    
```mermaid                                                                                    
                             
                               
```
