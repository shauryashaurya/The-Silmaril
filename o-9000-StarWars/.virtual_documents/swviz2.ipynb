# These advanced visualizations reveal deeper patterns in the Star Wars narrative:
# 
# - Each film follows a classic structure with rising action, climax, and resolution
# - Character appearances show how the ensemble cast moves through the story
# - The types of scenes evolve across the trilogy, with more emotional content in later films
# - Character co-occurrence reveals key character groupings and relationships
# - Locations show the expanding scope of the trilogy's universe
# - Character networks grow more complex and interconnected as the trilogy progresses
# - The balance between Rebel Alliance and Empire factions remains relatively constant
# - Certain characters dominate the memorable quotes and dialogue
# - Family relationships form the core of the saga's most important connections
# - Battles grow in scale and significance throughout the trilogy
# 
# These visualizations provide a deeper understanding of the storytelling techniques that made the original Star Wars trilogy a classic.
