## **Scenario-based competency questions** for Ontology #19: Cultural & Heritage Management           
           
1. **Heritage Site Erosion**             
   - “If a major **HistoricalSite** recognized by `UNESCOProgram` becomes severely damaged, do we forcibly reduce its exhibit availability in a certain `City`, or do we create an emergency ‘Festival’ to raise funds?”           
           
2. **Ethnic Group Relocation**             
   - “Which **EthnicGroup** decides to move from one **Nation** to another—how does that shift local population or reduce event attendance in the original city’s `CulturalEvent`?”           
           
3. **Subnational Conflict**             
   - “Which **Province** attempts to secede from a `Nation` and organizes new events—how does that affect the domain’s recognized sites or `hasAttraction` relationships?”           
           
4. **Publication Funding**             
   - “If a certain `MediaPublication` investsIn multiple `City` cultural expansions, can it now sponsorFestival for new `PerformingArtsGroup` events, or do we lack enough capital?”           
           
5. **Shrinking Language**             
   - “If usage of a certain `Language` drastically declines, do we see that any `Festival` or `CulturalEvent` referencing that language is canceled?”           
           
6. **Tourism Surge**             
   - “What if a certain `TouristAttraction` popularityIndex spikes from 5.0 to 9.0—do we reassign the `DiplomaticMission` or official visits, ensuring the city can handle extra arrivals?”           
           
7. **Merging Nations**             
   - “If two small `Nation` objects unify, how do we unify their `spokenLanguage`, `inhabitedBy(EthnicGroup)`, or `hasProvince` relationships?”           
           
8. **Museum Reassignment**             
   - “If a city’s major **Museum** is relocated, do we forcibly update all `exhibitsArtifact` references for that museum? Do we produce new sub-locations or partial merges?”           
           
9. **DiplomaticCultural Ties**             
   - “Which `DiplomaticMission` influences a certain city’s heritage site, but does not appear at any local festival or event? Possibly a scenario mismatch.”
