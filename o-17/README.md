# Ontology #17 A VERY _"out-there"_ Space Mission & Crew Domain           
             
## Domain           
           
Models space missions, spacecraft, crew membership, payload, launch sites, experiments, anomalies, and simulation modules.           
           
## Sample Competency Questions:           
           
* "Which mission uses which spacecraft, and who is on the crew?"           
* "Which mission anomalies have been encountered, and how do they affect the mission timeline?"           
* "Which payload is carried by which spacecraft for which experiment or docking module?"                 
* “Which missions lacked a stable orbit assignment but still had a positive outcome?”             
* “Which spacecraft was integrated into multiple simulation modules, and did any anomalies occur in related experiments?”             
* “How many crew members were insufficiently trained for the assigned orbit (midiChlorianCount < threshold?), if we do a comedic cross-lore reference?”             
* “Which battles or anomalies were triggered by a single meltdown in life-support capacity?”             
* “Which experiments rely on ground control from a different star system’s facility?”             
* “Which sith or jedi references exist in the data? (If crossing with star wars for comedic scenario!)”             
* “Which mission has no assigned launch site or vehicle, yet is marked ‘Active’?”           
           
**Palantir Foundry Context**:           
- Each **SpaceMission**, **Spacecraft**, **Crew** is an object type.             
- Transforms unify mission logs, anomalies, ground control facility references.             
- A code transform can run numeric or text analytics to detect mismatch or scenario triggers.             
- The branching approach helps if NASA-like updates arrive with new anomalies or changed mission data.

## **Scenario-based competency questions** for Ontology #17: Space Mission & Crew                      
                      
1. **Orbit Mismatch**: “If a **SpaceMission** fails to achieve the designated final orbit, do we forcibly reschedule the same mission in the pipeline or create a new ‘SimulationModule’ scenario for re-attempting the orbit injection?”                      
2. **Crew Reassignment**: “If half the mission’s crew cannot continue, do we find a partial solution with new characters or do we cancel the mission with an outcome code transform referencing the `SpaceMission.outcome = ‘Aborted’`?”                      
3. **Payload Overlimit**: “If a new cargo **Payload** surpasses the maxPayloadMass for the assigned **LaunchVehicle**, do we forcibly remove some items or do we spawn a second mission referencing the same **Spacecraft**?”                      
4. **DockingModule Fail**: “What if the **DockingModule** has capacity < the number of incoming vehicles—do we forcibly queue the vehicles or do some remain in orbit referencing the ‘SimulationModule’ fallback scenario?”                      
5. **Mission Anomaly**: “If a certain **Mission** encountered a major anomaly that triggers ‘MissionAnomaly’, do we see the final mission outcome as partial success or do we forcibly mark it as ‘Mission.outcome=Failed’ in the pipeline?”                      
6. **GroundControl Overload**: “Which **SpaceMission** objects rely on the same `GroundControl` that is also controlling too many concurrent tasks—does that degrade the successRate or produce new anomalies?”                      
7. **Crew vs. SpaceWalk**: “If the assigned crew lacks the skill for a certain `SpaceWalk` requiring high durationHrs, do we forcibly cancel or do we reduce the planned walk? We can run a scenario in the pipeline to recalc mission success.”                      
8. **Critical Timetable**: “If we shift the launchDate for a given `SpaceMission` earlier by 2 weeks, does that cause a scheduling conflict with the same `LaunchVehicle` or a partially assigned `LaunchSite`?”                      
9. **Asteroid Intercept**: “Which BFS or multi-hop scenario scenarioIncludes a new ‘Battle’ or event from an asteroid threat—any reason we must create a code transform to handle the new risk of the mission path?”
