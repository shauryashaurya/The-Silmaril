## Sample Competency Questions:                      
 	              
* “Which physicians, across multiple hospitals and clinics, are authorized to handle specialized surgeries?”             
* “Which patients have lab tests requiring immediate billing or coverage updates from their insurance plan?”             
* “How many appointments, across all medical departments, are scheduled with no matching physician in that specialty?”             
* “Which clinic has the highest cancellation rate, and which patient demographics are associated with it?”             
* “Which hospital invests in multiple advanced lab tests but lacks the matching lab department to process them?”           
           
**Palantir Foundry Context**:           
- **Hospital**, **Clinic**, **MedicalDepartment**, and **Physician** become object types.             
- Foundry pipelines handle appointment logs, medical records, lab test results, and insurance/billing data.             
- Code-workbooks or transforms can cross-check coverage or schedule constraints, highlighting data mismatches.             
- Incremental changes: you add new fields (like “telehealthSupport = true”) in a branch, test transformations, then merge.                                           
                                            
## **Scenario-based competency questions** for Ontology #16: Healthcare Network & Clinical                                            
                                            
1. **Doctor Shortage**: “If half the **Physician** staff in a certain **MedicalDepartment** are on leave, can the existing department handle all scheduled **Appointment** objects, or must some appointments route to a second department or external clinic?”                                            
2. **Claim Coverage**: “If a certain **InsurancePlan** modifies coverageType, do we see incomplete coverage for existing **BillingAccount** references in the pipeline? Could we detect unbillable **MedicalRecord** items?”                                            
3. **Emergency Overflow**: “If a **Hospital** bedCapacity is over capacity, does that automatically re-route new appointments to a different hospital or remain in a queue? Which code transform handles that logic in Foundry?”                                            
4. **LabTest Failure**: “If a certain lab device is offline, do we forcibly mark ‘requiresLabTest’ as deferred, or do we link patients to a different test center referencing the same ‘MedicalNetwork’?”                                            
5. **Physician Transfer**: “If a **Physician** changes specialization from general to cardiology, do we break existing references to the old dept, or do we keep them with partial references for historical appointments?”                                            
6. **InsurancePlan Mergers**: “If two insurance plans unify, do we unify all relevant ‘coveredBy’ references, or do we keep separate coverage for each existing BillingAccount?”                                            
7. **Clinic No-Show**: “Which **Appointment** remain with status=‘NoShow’ for repeated visits, does that push any new ‘MedicalRecord’ with partial data or no data at all?”                                            
8. **Experimental Trials**: “If a new **ResearchStudy** references a ‘Patient’ group, but that patient has conflicting coverage or is assigned to a certain department, do we see any data pipeline conflict in Foundry?”                                            
9. **Pandemic Surge**: “Which hospitals must forcibly create new ICU expansions or partial bed expansions to handle an influx of patients? If the pipeline indicates bedCapacity < x, do we auto redirect or produce an alert?”
