# A **Star Wars** Ontology!                    
        
## Citation        
Inspired by [Dorian Smiley's The Star Wars Stack](https://github.com/doriansmiley/TheStarWarsStack) idea, which in turn is inspired by the ["Ticker Symbol: YOU" (channel) video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq3JjUUgTBI&t=924s)          
My attempt is to just try and craft an almost simple ontology, not the full blown project, and slowly grow it so it can run simulations and scenarios on the fictional timeline of Star Wars.           
This is very cool, but just for fun...

## Ontology Structure: Core Classes / Entities (Domain Ontology)                
                
Below is a conceptual structure, with a **pseudocode** approach.         
        
                
                
                                                              
```mermaid                                                              
      
         
```                                                 
                                                            
---                                  
                                  
```pseudocode                                

        
                 
```                    
                    
## **Scenario-based competency questions** for Ontology #12: System Monitoring & Maintenance Domain           
           
1. **Maintenance Order Delays**: “What if the primary **Technician** assigned to a high-priority **MaintenanceOrder** becomes unavailable—do we have a backup technician or do we risk a system-level failure for certain **Subsystem** components?”           
2. **Signal Overload**: “Which **Sensor** emits a **Signal** that surpasses a threshold readingValue—could that trigger a chain of **Alert** events requiring immediate reconfiguration of the **Component**’s status in a given **Subsystem**?”           
3. **Failure Mode Cascades**: “If a specific **FailureMode** in a **Component** is left unaddressed, does it propagate additional signals that create more **Alert** events, saturating the ‘SimulationProfile’ predictions?”           
4. **Profile Tuning**: “What if we tune down the risk threshold in a certain **SimulationProfile**—which new **Alert** events appear that previously went undetected in the system?”           
5. **Tech Reassignment**: “If a single **Technician** is assigned to multiple **MaintenanceOrder** tasks concurrently, does the system see a backlog or unhandled priority levels for certain ‘requiresMaintenance’ components?”           
6. **Subsystem Deactivation**: “Which **Subsystem** can we safely deactivate for partial system updates without generating catastrophic ‘Alert’ signals in the rest of the system?”           
7. **Signal Logging Gaps**: “What if the logger for a certain **Sensor** fails to produce a new **Signal**—does that raise a special ‘Alert’ or trigger a fallback maintenance order?”           
8. **Rules Upgrade**: “If we expand the system with an advanced **SimulationProfile** referencing new **FailureMode** complexities, do existing **Component** references remain consistent or do we force a major system re-check?”           
9. **System Overhaul**: “If the entire **System** version updates from v1 to v2, do we reassign all existing maintenance tasks or do we keep them assigned to the same **Technician** pool? Which constraints or references might break?”
