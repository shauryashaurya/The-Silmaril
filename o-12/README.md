## **Competency Questions**:           
           
1. “Which subsystem’s components have generated the most alerts in the last month?”             
2. “Are there any signals indicating potential failure modes that haven’t been assigned a maintenance order?”             
3. “Which signals triggered the highest severity alerts, and did the technician respond in time?”             
4. “Which simulation profiles are used for each failure mode, and how often do we run them?”             
5. “How many components require maintenance but do not have an assigned technician yet?”           
           
**Palantir Foundry Context**:           
- Each **object type** (System, Subsystem, Component, etc.) maps to Foundry datasets.             
- **Signals** might come from streaming data sets; you define typed transforms for “Sensor → Signal.”             
- You can do transforms to produce **Alerts** or MaintenanceOrders, and lineages help track the chain from “Component–Sensor–Signal–Alert–Technician.”             
- **SimulationProfile** can be an object type referencing a pipeline that simulates or predicts failure scenarios, then merges results back into Foundry.                                        
                                            
## **Scenario-based competency questions** for Ontology #12: System Monitoring & Maintenance Domain                                            
                                            
1. **Maintenance Order Delays**: “What if the primary **Technician** assigned to a high-priority **MaintenanceOrder** becomes unavailable—do we have a backup technician or do we risk a system-level failure for certain **Subsystem** components?”                                            
2. **Signal Overload**: “Which **Sensor** emits a **Signal** that surpasses a threshold readingValue—could that trigger a chain of **Alert** events requiring immediate reconfiguration of the **Component**’s status in a given **Subsystem**?”                                            
3. **Failure Mode Cascades**: “If a specific **FailureMode** in a **Component** is left unaddressed, does it propagate additional signals that create more **Alert** events, saturating the ‘SimulationProfile’ predictions?”                                            
4. **Profile Tuning**: “What if we tune down the risk threshold in a certain **SimulationProfile**—which new **Alert** events appear that previously went undetected in the system?”                                            
5. **Tech Reassignment**: “If a single **Technician** is assigned to multiple **MaintenanceOrder** tasks concurrently, does the system see a backlog or unhandled priority levels for certain ‘requiresMaintenance’ components?”                                            
6. **Subsystem Deactivation**: “Which **Subsystem** can we safely deactivate for partial system updates without generating catastrophic ‘Alert’ signals in the rest of the system?”                                            
7. **Signal Logging Gaps**: “What if the logger for a certain **Sensor** fails to produce a new **Signal**—does that raise a special ‘Alert’ or trigger a fallback maintenance order?”                                            
8. **Rules Upgrade**: “If we expand the system with an advanced **SimulationProfile** referencing new **FailureMode** complexities, do existing **Component** references remain consistent or do we force a major system re-check?”                                            
9. **System Overhaul**: “If the entire **System** version updates from v1 to v2, do we reassign all existing maintenance tasks or do we keep them assigned to the same **Technician** pool? Which constraints or references might break?”
