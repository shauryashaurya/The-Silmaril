    %%  'songsOnAlbum' is inverse of 'featuredOn'.
    %%  'songsOnAlbum(album1, song1)' infers 'featuredOn(song1, album1)'.
    %%  'featuredOn(song2, album2)' infers 'songsOnAlbum(album2, song2)'.


    %% Functional Properties (Examples)
    %% Example: Assuming a unique song ID
    Song -- hasUniqueSongID_string --> hasUniqueSongID[(hasUniqueSongID)] 
    %% If hasUniqueSongID is functional: hasUniqueSongID(song1, "ID123") and hasUniqueSongID(song1, "ID124") is a contradiction.

    %% Example Assuming a unique Album ID
    Album -- hasUniqueAlbumID_string --> hasUniqueAlbumID[(hasUniqueAlbumID)] 

    %% Inverse Functional Properties (Examples)
    Artist -- hasUniqueArtistID_string --> hasUniqueArtistID[(hasUniqueArtistID)]
    %% If hasUniqueArtistID is inverse functional:  hasUniqueArtistID(artist1, "ID456") and hasUniqueArtistID(artist2, "ID456") infers artist1 = artist2.
      
     %% Transitive/Symmetric (consider adding based on domain needs, e.g., relatedGenre)
     %% Example Transitive:  isInfluencedBy(GenreA, GenreB) and isInfluencedBy(GenreB, GenreC) infers isInfluencedBy(GenreA, GenreC)
     %% Example Symmetric: isSimilarTo(SongA, SongB) infers isSimilarTo(SongB, SongA)
    
    %% Disjoint Classes (If we had them, e.g., Song and Artist)
    %% subgraph DisjointClasses
    %%    Song -- disjointWith --> Artist
    %% end
    %% owlrl would infer that no individual can be both a Song and an Artist

    %% Class Hierarchy (If we had subclasses, e.g., StudioAlbum and LiveAlbum)
    %% subgraph ClassHierarchy
    %%      Album <|-- StudioAlbum
    %%      Album <|-- LiveAlbum
    %%  end
    %%  owlrl would infer that any instance of StudioAlbum is also an instance of Album.
